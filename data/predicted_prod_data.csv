Job Description,0
"Client is smart team communication software that unifies all messages, data, and documentation to help you focus on the work that matters. By aligning teams through action-based communication, Client drastically reduces email volume and creates more efficient, productive, and collaborative workflows across organizations.",0
"With Client , any team—no matter the size or location—can work as one to achieve empowered alignment and maximum productivity.",0
"So what does that mean ? Story mode: Remember when the Ever Given got stuck in the Suez Canal? Imagine what it takes to move a ship like that, that has thousands of containers; There are hundreds of stakeholders around the cargo, and dozens more around the ship. The ship has an owner, it is often rented and operated by another company, it is crewed, fueled, cleaned and docked; cargo is loaded, unloaded, and needs to comply with country specific and cargo specific regulations. There may be taxes or tariffs and fees to be paid etc. etc. All of this and more is done through emails, thousands of them, per journey. (Hey, at least it isn’t fax and telex like it was in memory more recent than you’d imagine.) These thousands of emails are handled by a team of dozens of people, in a company of hundreds. Now, because most emails carry some information, request, or report in them, many emails might traditionally trigger a flurry of other emails (“Hey Jody, can you attach the filled customs forms”, “Hey Mike, did you see this?” , “Alex, is this the price we agreed upon” )",0
"Client attacks all of these problems, emails no longer engender other emails, the internal “chat” can take care of that, it also allows everyone to keep track of who has the ball on any action item. Client also makes sure that the right people see the right emails, and minimizes the number of people who see an email (and therefore of emails seen by each person). Auxiliary data such as files relevant to the project can be attached with a single click, and integration with external systems allows for further automation and tie-ins.",0
"We work hard and strive for results. We also value people’s lives outside of work. The people of Client are world travellers, devoted parents, ultra marathon runners, knitting enthusiasts, animal lovers, ski adventurers, hip hop dancers, Canada Games athletes, emergency response volunteers, and so much more. We’re told that one of the best things about working at Client is that everyone is empowered to solve large problems and that everyone’s opinion is valued.",0
