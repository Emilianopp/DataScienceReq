1481,About the job
1482,"Before you read any further: Our strength at Opencare relies on the diversity of perspective that we work hard to craft on our team. We are all solving the same set of problems from our own unique lenses, and this is fundamental to our success as a business. Experience means something different to each of us, and your unique combination of skills, passions, and experiences makes you a valuable asset to our team."
1483,Opencare’s Vision
1484,"To enable people to have optimal health of mind and body, by ensuring they get the preventive care they need. "
1485,"Opencare is re-designing the dentist visit with a focus on wellness. We live our most important life moments, from laughing and smiling to eating and talking, through our mouths. Yet for such an important body part, the thought of visiting the dentist instills fear and confusion in most people. To us, that doesn’t make any sense."
1486,"That’s why we’re rebuilding every moment of the dental experience; not only to be impactful during the visit, but life enriching afterward, too. If you never thought you’d say “Wow, I love my dentist!”, our goal is to get you there."
1487,"We believe that people reach their full potential at work when they are happy and healthy outside of work. You can learn more about our culture, as well as our professional and personal benefits here. You can also hear about it directly from our team here. "

1489,"Our Data team is driven by providing meaningful insights across the business that will accelerate our growth. Our analysts and data scientists work on problems that dive deep into understanding how our customers behave and how we can serve them better because we know that when we can help someone find a great dentist and prioritize their mouth wellness it’s a win-win-win. This means that our team is focused on big problems like supply / demand balancing, event-based attribution across multiple channels both online and offline, understanding the impact of complex communication flows, and ensuring that when we run experiments we’re learning as much as we can. "
1490,How will you help to get us there?

This is an exciting opportunity for someone with a deep understanding of paid advertising who is very comfortable rolling their sleeves up in data sets. If you’re someone who gets excited about the “so what” of your analysis and wants to drive business outcomes, this is the role for you!"
1492,"By diving deep to understand how our ads convert, this Data Analyst will play a key role in shaping our marketing and growth strategies to help us understand how to connect with the right consumer, at the right time, and with the right value proposition. "

1496,"Navigating through our marketing data to distill key insights, inform rapid and iterative experimentation, and drive critical business decisions for our Sales and Marketing team"
1497,"Using  segmentation and attribution models to improve decision making, understand where value is created, and unlocking major growth in new and existing channels"

3668,About the job
3669,Job Description
3670,"Client is smart team communication software that unifies all messages, data, and documentation to help you focus on the work that matters. By aligning teams through action-based communication, Client drastically reduces email volume and creates more efficient, productive, and collaborative workflows across organizations."
3671,"With Client , any team—no matter the size or location—can work as one to achieve empowered alignment and maximum productivity."
3672,"So what does that mean ? Story mode: Remember when the Ever Given got stuck in the Suez Canal? Imagine what it takes to move a ship like that, that has thousands of containers; There are hundreds of stakeholders around the cargo, and dozens more around the ship. The ship has an owner, it is often rented and operated by another company, it is crewed, fueled, cleaned and docked; cargo is loaded, unloaded, and needs to comply with country specific and cargo specific regulations. There may be taxes or tariffs and fees to be paid etc. etc. All of this and more is done through emails, thousands of them, per journey. (Hey, at least it isn’t fax and telex like it was in memory more recent than you’d imagine.) These thousands of emails are handled by a team of dozens of people, in a company of hundreds. Now, because most emails carry some information, request, or report in them, many emails might traditionally trigger a flurry of other emails (“Hey Jody, can you attach the filled customs forms”, “Hey Mike, did you see this?” , “Alex, is this the price we agreed upon” )"
3673,"Client attacks all of these problems, emails no longer engender other emails, the internal “chat” can take care of that, it also allows everyone to keep track of who has the ball on any action item. Client also makes sure that the right people see the right emails, and minimizes the number of people who see an email (and therefore of emails seen by each person). Auxiliary data such as files relevant to the project can be attached with a single click, and integration with external systems allows for further automation and tie-ins."
3674,"We work hard and strive for results. We also value people’s lives outside of work. The people of Client are world travellers, devoted parents, ultra marathon runners, knitting enthusiasts, animal lovers, ski adventurers, hip hop dancers, Canada Games athletes, emergency response volunteers, and so much more. We’re told that one of the best things about working at Client is that everyone is empowered to solve large problems and that everyone’s opinion is valued."

3677,Responsible for using ML/AI to help Client and its clients extract intelligence from emails
3678,Building production ready components that will be used by the product / integrations.
